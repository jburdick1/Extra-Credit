Developing algorithms for various trading cases and live data

I have worked to build on the topics we have learned in OIM3640 by appling them to trading. Without the knowledge of apis and data structures I learned in class, 
I would not have been able to build these comprehensive trading algorithms 

I would also like to note that I took a second shot at several of the quizes and answered questions I hadn't previously been able to get to.
